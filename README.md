# Broswer use experimentation

## Aim
I am attempting to create a browser use agent that lets me apply to jobs online. The flow I have in mind is simple:
1) Search the internet for jobs
2) Find the most recent job from the last 7 days
2) a) for initila scope, just limit to lever or ashby or one of the big ones        
 sidenote: fuck workday
3) Fill my information up
4) Use resume, upload resume
5) Hit submit
